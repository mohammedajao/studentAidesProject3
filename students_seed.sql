-- If a database named “students” already exists, delete it

-- Create a database named “students” with the following schema:
--      id (should be the PRIMARY KEY when making new row)
--      name (example: “Mahdi Shadkamfarrokhi”)
--      age (example: 32)
--      cohort (example: “Bond Collective”)
--      grade (example: 12)
--      fav_hobby (example: “coding”)

-- Add the following students and their information to the “students” database:
--      Bob Bobbington/15/Goldman Sachs/11/eating
--      Juan Pablo/17/JPMC/12/gaming
--      Jerry Mathews/16/Bond Collective/11/coding
--      Anthony Quinn/15/Yahoo/11/bowling
--      Kevin Calderon/17/Bond Collective/12/styling

-- Make the following modifications (as a separate command) to the “students” database:
--      Change Anthony Quinn’s cohort to “Facebook”
--      Change Juan Pablo’s age to 16
--      Change Kevin Calderon’s fav_hobby to “stuntin’”

-- BONUS:
--      Add yourself to the database!
--      Have the fav_hobby have a default of “dabbing” if no value is given
